# ============================================================================
# API KEY SYSTEM FOR MOBILE CLIENTS
# ============================================================================
# Mobile app integrations use API keys to authenticate and receive their own
# issuer addresses for credential issuance. This allows:
#
# 1. Each mobile client has their own Algorand issuer wallet address
# 2. Credentials are signed by the client's issuer (not the main app)
# 3. Clients can be individually revoked via the Issuer Registry
# 4. Rate limiting and monitoring per client
#
# CONFIGURATION:
# API keys are configured in: app/config/api-keys.config.ts
# See: app/config/api-keys.example.ts for template
#
# SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MOBILE CLIENTS:
# - Credentials MUST be stored encrypted on device (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
# - Credentials MUST be tamper-proof (implement integrity checks)
# - Third party clients receive their own issuer address
# - Violation of TOS or security breaches result in removal from issuer registry
#
# REQUESTING AN API KEY:
# Contact us at: https://cardlessid.org/contact
# Provide: Organization name, use case, expected volume
#
# See full documentation: docs/MOBILE_CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md
# ============================================================================

# Mobile Client API Key Configuration
# These environment variables configure the API key for your mobile app
# Generate API key with: openssl rand -hex 32

# Mobile Client Issuer Credentials
# Option 1: Use separate issuer for mobile (recommended for production)
# MOBILE_ISSUER_ADDRESS=MOBILE_CLIENT_ALGORAND_ADDRESS_58_CHARS
# MOBILE_ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY=mobile_client_base64_private_key

# Option 2: Use same issuer as web app (simpler for development/testing)
# Leave these commented out and it will use VITE_APP_WALLET_ADDRESS and ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY
# This is fine for testing but production should use separate issuers
