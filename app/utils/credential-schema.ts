  "Cardless ID uses W3C Verifiable Credentials with a composite identity hash for sybil-resistant duplicate detection. " +
  "Each credential includes a cryptographic proof (Ed25519 signature) that prevents forgery - only the legitimate issuer can create valid credentials. " +
  "The credential also includes a W3C-standard 'evidence' property with detailed verification metadata (fraud detection, OCR confidence, biometric matching) for risk assessment. " +
  "The mobile wallet stores both the credential (with hash and evidence) and the original unhashed data locally for user access.";

export const USAGE_NOTES = {
  verification:
    "Verifiers should validate the proof signature against the issuer's public key (derived from the Algorand address in the issuer DID). " +
    "The signature is created from the credential WITHOUT the proof field. Use algosdk.verifyBytes() with the issuer's public key to verify authenticity. " +
    "The compositeHash prevents duplicate credentials from the same person. " +
    "The evidence property contains verification quality metrics for risk-based trust decisions.",
  wallet:
    "Mobile wallets receive both the credential (with compositeHash, evidence, and cryptographic proof) and the original unhashed personal data (for local storage and user access). " +
    "The evidence property includes fraud detection results, OCR confidence levels, and biometric matching scores that can be used for risk assessment.",
  extension:
    "Additional claims can be added using custom namespaces while preserving core cardlessid: fields. " +
    "The W3C-standard evidence property is extensible and can include additional verification methods.",
  proof:
    "The proof.proofValue contains a base64-encoded Ed25519 signature. " +
    "To verify: 1) Remove the proof field from credential, 2) Convert to canonical JSON, 3) Verify signature using issuer's public key from Algorand. " +
    "Note: The evidence property is included in the signed data, ensuring verification metadata cannot be tampered with.",
  evidence:
    "The evidence array follows W3C VC Data Model standards and includes DocumentVerification evidence with fraud detection (Google Document AI), " +
    "document analysis (AWS Textract OCR confidence), and biometric verification (AWS Rekognition face match and liveness). " +
    "Quality levels (high/medium/low) help relying parties make risk-based acceptance decisions. " +
    "High quality requires: fraud check passed, both ID sides processed, no low-confidence fields, and strong biometric scores.",
