# Cardless ID

24 US states and countries including the UK, France and Germany have passed laws requiring adult sites to verify age.

We agree that children should never have access to sexually explicit material. However, we also believe the verification process should be:

1. Extremely private, and not require any information except birth date
1. Only necessary to do one time across all _adult_ web sites
1. Provided by a nonprofit that does not retain or monetize your data
1. Free for end users and providers alike

We partner with content companies, technology providers, media and regulators to make this possible.

This project is in active development. We're collaborating with partners to integrate existing decentralized identity tools that give end users maximum control of what information is shared. This ensures compatibility with all major blockchain networks.
